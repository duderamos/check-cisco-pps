# check_cisco_pps
=====================

It is a Nagios plugin which gets from Cisco Switch via SNMP the Packet Per Second rate.

Example:

# Cisco 2960S interface GigabitEthernet 1/0/1
./check_cisco_pps 172.16.42.75 community 10101
OK IN=3072 OUT=3137 | IN=3072 OUT=3137

# Cisco 2960S total of all interfaces
./check_cisco_pps 172.16.42.75 community
OK IN=6785 OUT=7078 | IN=6785 OUT=7078

Obs.: This script was only tested on Cisco 2960S.
